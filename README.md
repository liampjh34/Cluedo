# Cluedo

As part of exercise 45 of Learn Python The Hard Way, it's time to code my own game.

For this I've decided to code a version of Cluedo, which involves:
- randomly setting up the game
- distributing cards, with different amounts of distribution based on number of NPCs
- travelling to different rooms to make guesses and returning any matches
- making an accusal
